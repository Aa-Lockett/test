# Kanban Task Manager MVP

This project implements a minimal Kanban-style task manager in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It provides three columns (Todo, Doing, Done) where tasks can be created and moved between columns via drag and drop.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No build step or server is required.

1. Enter a task name in the input field under the **Todo** column.
2. Click **Add** to create the task.
3. Drag and drop tasks between the columns to update their status.
